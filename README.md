# Synthesized Notebooks

This repository contains a variety of notebooks to show-case the SDK capabilities.

### Creating a General-Purpose Generative Model for Structured Data

Apply the Synthesized SDK to automatically create a generative model for any datasets to bootstrap data where the density of data is low, automatically reshape data as you like, and even anonymise data for repurposing.

### Synthesized Privacy Tools

Explore additional privacy capabilities and evaluate it with different metrics based on complex attacks performed on generated that, that aim to extract as much sensitive information as possible from generated datasets.
