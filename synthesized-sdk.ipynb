    "\n",
    "Welcome to the demo notebook, where we showcase some of the core features of the Synthesized SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can apply the Synthesized SDK to automatically create a **general-purpose generative model** for any dataset, enabling easy solutions to a wide range of classic data problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks at 4 different examples:\n",
    "1. Bootstrap data where the density of data is low\n",
    "2. Automatically reshape data as you like\n",
    "3. Anonymise data for repurposing\n",
    "4. Identify biases in structured data **(Latest release!)**\n",
    " \n",
    "**Note:**\n",

    "If you want to save your progress and come back to your work in a new session you must copy this notebook to your Google Drive.\n",
