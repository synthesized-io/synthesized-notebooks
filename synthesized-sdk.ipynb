        "1.  Bootstrap data where the density of data is low\n",
        "2.  Automatically reshape data as you like \n",
        "3.  Anonymise data for repurposing\n",
        "4.  Explore signals of bias in an unfair dataset **(New!)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, there are countless doors unlocked once you equip your dataset with a generative model. You can learn about some of these other features of the Synthesized SDK [in the Docs](https://docs.synthesized.io/v1.4/). \n",

        "**Note: This is a Google Colab version of the SDK.** In order to use the SDK outside Colab in a production environment, on-premise/private cloud, connect to databases, intergrate into ETL, being able to work with Spark and big data sources natively, or just moving beyond a single dataframe in memory and more reach out to letschat@synthesized.io for a commercial version of the SDK. You can read more about it here http://synthesized.io/sdk-for-data-manipulation.\n",
